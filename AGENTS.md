# AGENTS.md

This file gives coding agents repository-specific operating instructions.

## Project intent

Benchplane is a reproducible AI-systems performance laboratory. Avoid narrowing the design to only vLLM, AWS, inference, NVIDIA, or NixOS even though those form the initial implementation path.

## Immediate goal

Complete a small, reviewable local vertical slice before implementing AWS provisioning:

1. parse and validate `benchplane/v1alpha1` experiment YAML;
2. resolve defaults deterministically;
3. generate checked-in JSON Schema;
4. produce and verify a miniature local-fake evidence bundle;
5. make `nix flake check` and ordinary CI green without AWS or a GPU.

## Boundaries

- `benchplane` is the thin CLI crate.
- `benchplane-schema` owns public data types and validation.
- `benchplane-core` owns lifecycle, resolution, evidence, analysis, provider, and runtime logic.
- Framework code must not import or embed files from `experiments/` or `studies/`.
- Keep AWS and vLLM as concrete modules until a second real implementation proves an extraction boundary.

## Safety and cost

- Never add credentials, tokens, OpenTofu state, pre-signed URLs, or private account identifiers.
- Never place secrets in Nix derivations or the Nix store.
- Do not add an AWS apply path without explicit maximum runtime, maximum cost, run tags, state isolation, artifact finalization, and unconditional teardown.
- Ordinary pull-request CI must not contact AWS.

## Change discipline

- Make the smallest coherent change that advances the current milestone.
- Add tests for behavior, not only structure.
- Prefer explicit tagged schema variants over speculative plugin systems.
- Do not add placeholder CLI commands that only print “not implemented.”
- Do not introduce Kubernetes, a web UI, a database, multi-cloud support, or a plugin ABI during the initial milestone.
- Update an ADR when changing an architectural decision.

## Expected checks

Use the supported Nix environment for Rust development and checks:

```console
nix develop
just fmt
just check
```

Commands may instead be invoked explicitly with `nix develop -c <command>`. Direct Cargo use outside the pinned Nix environment is currently best-effort; when Nix is unavailable, clearly report which supported checks could not be executed.
